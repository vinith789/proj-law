    "In CrPC chapter:3 and section:31 \n Title: Sentence in cases of conviction of several offences at one trial \n Description: When a person is convicted at one trial of two or more offences, the Court may, subject to the provisions of section 71 of the Indian Penal Code (45 of 1860), sentence him for such offences, to the several punishments, prescribed therefore which such Court is competent to inflict; such punishments when consisting of imprisonment to commence the one after the expiration of the other in such order as the Court may direct, unless the Court directs that such punishments shall run concurrently.\n\t\tIn the case of consecutive sentences, it shall not be necessary for the Court by reason only of the aggregate punishment for the several offences being in excess of the punishment which it is competent to inflict on conviction of a single offence, to send the offender for trial before a higher Court;\nProvided thatâ€”\n\t\t\n\t\t\tin no case shall such person be sentenced to imprisonment for a longer period than fourteen years;\n\t\t\tthe aggregate punishment shall not exceed twice the amount of punishment which the Court is competent to inflict for a single offence.\n\t\t\n\t\tFor the purpose of appeal by a convicted person, the aggregate of the consecutive sentences passed against him under this section shall be deemed to be a single sentence."
